# Scenario

An ecologist studying a rocky shore at Phillip Island, in southeastern Australia, was interested in how
clumps of intertidal mussels are maintained [@Quinn-1988-137]. In particular, he wanted to know how densities of adult
mussels affected recruitment of young individuals from the plankton. As with most marine invertebrates,
recruitment is highly patchy in time, so he expected to find seasonal variation, and the interaction
between season and density - whether effects of adult mussel density vary across seasons - was the aspect
of most interest.

The data were collected from four seasons, and with two densities of adult mussels. The experiment
consisted of clumps of adult mussels attached to the rocks. These clumps were then brought back to the
laboratory, and the number of baby mussels recorded. There were 3-6 replicate clumps for each density
and season combination.

# Read in the data

```{r readData, results='markdown', eval=TRUE}
quinn = read_csv('../data/quinn.csv', trim_ws=TRUE)
glimpse(quinn)
```

```{r dataprep, results='markdown', eval=TRUE}
quinn = quinn %>% mutate(SEASON = factor(SEASON),
                         DENSITY = factor(DENSITY))
```

	
# Exploratory data analysis
	
Model formula:
$$
\begin{align}
y_i &\sim{} \mathcal{Pois}(\lambda_i)\\
ln(\mu_i) &= \boldsymbol{\beta} \bf{X_i}\\[1em]
\end{align}
$$
                                           
where $\boldsymbol{\beta}$ is a vector of effects parameters and $\bf{X}$
is a model matrix representing the intercept and effects of season, density and their interaction on mussel recruitment.

```{r eda}
ggplot(quinn, aes(y=RECRUITS, x=SEASON, fill=DENSITY)) +
     geom_boxplot() #there's a relationship between mean and variance

ggplot(quinn, aes(y=RECRUITS, x=SEASON, fill=DENSITY)) +
geom_boxplot() +
scale_y_log10() #no more relationship between mean and variance, because of the log transformation
```
#Why the sqrt transformation is not a good idea.
- If you're transforming your data, you want to be able to back transform.
- When you back transform from a sqrt transformation, the order of the data can change, because of the negative values becoming positive.
- A better option is possion, or negbin (or log+1)


# Fit the model

```{r fitModel}
quinn.glm <- glm(log(RECRUITS+1) ~ DENSITY*SEASON, data=quinn, family=gaussian)
quinn.glm1 <- glm(RECRUITS ~ DENSITY*SEASON, data=quinn,
                  family=poisson(link='log'))
AICc(quinn.glm, quinn.glm1)
```
The gaussian model with the logs, is the better fit. Not necessarily the most logical.

# Model validation

```{r ValidateModel, results='markdown', eval=TRUE}
autoplot(quinn.glm,which=1:6)
autoplot(quinn.glm1,which=1:6)
```

```{r modelValidation2, results='markdown', eval=TRUE}
## goodness of fit
1-pchisq(quinn.glm1$deviance, df=quinn.glm1$df.residual) #there's evidence that the poisson distribution is not a good fit
#it could be because our data is overdispersed


## any evidence of overdispersion
quinn.glm1$deviance/quinn.glm1$df.residual #there's evidence for overdispersion, because it is more than 3 
```

```{r modelValidation3, results='markdown', eval=TRUE}
## is this due to excessive zeros (zero-inflation)
tab=table(quinn$RECRUITS==0) #40 non zeros and 2 zeros
tab/sum(tab)
## 5% of the observations are zero. it is not many.. so it cant be zero-inflated.we don't worry about it unless it is more than 15%
#Negbin accounts for the additional level of zeros...

## how many 0's would we expect from a poisson distribution with a mean similar to our mean
mean(quinn$RECRUITS) #the mean of our data would be about 18. I wouldn't expect many zeros, because it is close to the right end of the distribution
x=rpois(100000,lambda=mean(quinn$RECRUITS)) #generating 100k values from a pois distribution, with the same mean as our data
tab.1 = table(x==0) #asking how many of these are equal to zero
tab.1/sum(tab.1) #by chance, I expect no zeros out of 100k
```

```{r fitModel2, results='markdown', eval=TRUE}

```{r modelValidation5, results='markdown', eval=TRUE}
## goodness of fit

#some evidence for lack of fit

## any evidence of overdispersion

# Predictions

```{r mainEffects, results='markdown', eval=TRUE}

#our various contrasts tell us that there is no evidence for a density effect in autumn, spring or winter.

emmeans(quinn.nb, pairwise~DENSITY|SEASON, type='response')
#for summer, there is twice as many recruits in high density, compared to low density. the same ratio is at winter as well, but there is a higher SE, so we are not as confident.

confint(emmeans(quinn.nb, pairwise~DENSITY|SEASON), type='response')

eff = confint(emmeans(quinn.nb, pairwise~DENSITY|SEASON), type='response')
#we capture the effects in a vector
