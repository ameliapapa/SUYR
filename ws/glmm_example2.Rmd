# Scenario

To investigate differential metabolic plasticity in barramundi (*Lates calcarifer*),
@Norin-2016-369 exposed juvenile barramundi to various environmental changes (increased temperature,
decreased salinity and increased hypoxia) as well as control conditions.
Metabolic plasticity was calculated as the percentage difference in standard metabolic rate between
the various treatment conditions and the standard metabolic rate under control conditions.
They were interested in whether there was a relationship between metabolic plasticity and typical (control) metabolism and
how the different treatment conditions impact on this relationship.

A total of 60 barramundi juveniles were subject to each of the three conditions (high temperature,
low salinity and hypoxia) in addition to control conditions.
Fish mass was also recorded as a covariate as this is known to influence metabolic parameters.

# Read in the data

```{r readData, results='markdown', eval=TRUE}
norin = read_csv('../data/norin.csv', trim_ws=TRUE)
glimpse(norin)

norin = norin %>% mutate(FISHID = factor(FISHID), TRIAL = factor(TRIAL))
```


# Exploratory data analysis

Model formula:
$$
y_i \sim{} \mathcal{N}(\mu_i, \sigma^2)\\
\mu_i =\boldsymbol{\beta} \bf{X_i} + \boldsymbol{\gamma} \bf{Z_i}
$$

where $\boldsymbol{\beta}$ and $\boldsymbol{\gamma}$ are vectors of the fixed and random effects parameters respectively 
and $\bf{X}$ is the  model matrix representing the overall intercept and effects of temperature and (centered) mean fish size on SDA peak.
$\bf{Z}$ represents a cell means model matrix for the random intercepts associated with individual fish.
```{r}
ggplot(norin, aes(TRIAL, CHANGE)) + geom_boxplot()
ggplot(norin, aes(SMR_contr, CHANGE, shape = TRIAL, color = TRIAL)) +
  geom_smooth(method= 'lm') + geom_point()
```

```{r}
ggplot(norin, aes(y= CHANGE, x = as.numeric(FISHID), color = TRIAL)) + 
  geom_point() + geom_line()
#we will consider using random slopes, because the lines intersect, and they're not always consistent
```

```{r}
ggplot(norin, aes(y= CHANGE, x = MASS, color = TRIAL)) + 
  geom_point() + geom_smooth(method = 'lm')
#combining categorical and numerical data -> homogeneity of slopes
```


# Fit the model
```{r}
norin.lme = lme(CHANGE ~ TRIAL*SMR_contr+ MASS, random = ~1|FISHID, data = norin, method = 'ML')
#any variable you add, adds a cost -> reduced df of residual -> power comes from df of residuals

#you can add a covariate without costing the df of residual:
norin.lme1 = lme(CHANGE ~ TRIAL*SMR_contr+ offset(MASS), random = ~1|FISHID, data = norin, method = 'ML')
#an offset allows you to add a covariate, without consuming any df, because it doesn't estimate anything, but rather assumes
#In this case, ot assumes theres a relationship between change and mass, and it assumes it has a slope of 1. for every 1 unit in change of MASS, there will be 1 change of unit in CHANGE
#

norin.lme1 = lme(CHANGE ~ TRIAL*SMR_contr, random = ~1|FISHID, data = norin, method = 'ML')
```

# Model validation
```{r}

#we go for the simpler model with lower AIC
```

```{r}
norin.lme1 = update(norin.lme1, method = 'REML')
#norin.lme2 = update(norin.lme1, random = ~SMR_contr|FISHID, method = 'REML')
#the model is too complicated to arrive to a conclusion
norin.lme2 = update(norin.lme1, random = ~SMR_contr|FISHID, method = 'REML',
                    control = lmeControl(opt='optim'))
#We've switched it to the simplex optimizer. It requires more iterations (it is slower).
#In a frequentist paradigm, you might be sitting in the end of the frequentist framework

```

# Model investigation / hypothesis testing

#162 is the CHANGE in high temp group, when SMR_contr = 0

#There is evidence of interaction between hypoxia and the change in metabolic rate
