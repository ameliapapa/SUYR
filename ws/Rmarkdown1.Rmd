# Introduction

Markdown is a __markup__ language that provides very simple styling rules all in 
plain text.  It has an emphasis on allowing the author to concentrate on content
rather than formatting.

Its simplicity makes it ideal as a base format from which to convert to other formats such
as:

- html
- pdf (via LaTeX)
- word
- epub
- etc

**pandoc** is an open sources universal document converter. Rstudio comes shipped
with pandoc.


An **Rmarkdown** file is a markdown document in which R code is embedded.

An R "chunk" is defined as:

```{r}
rnorm(100)
```

When the Rmarkdown document is **knitted**, the `knit()` routine evaluates all the R chunks
and inserts the output (in markdown format) into the document before it is processed by __pandoc__
to yield the final format.

Equations are included between single \$ (for inline equations) and double \$\$ for blocked equations like:

$Y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 F_i$

where $y_i$ is the response.

Mathematical formulae are processed using mathjax (for html and word) or LaTeX for pdf.
